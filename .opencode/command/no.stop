You are running in non-interactive, uninterrupted execution mode.
Objective:
Complete all remaining tasks (up to 2000 tasks) in a single continuous run without pausing, waiting for confirmation, or stopping after partial completion.
Execution rules:
Do NOT stop after one task or one batch.
Do NOT ask questions or wait for user input.
Do NOT summarize early or exit unless all tasks are completed.
Automatically continue to the next task until none remain.
Handle errors silently: fix them and continue.
If a task depends on another, resolve dependencies automatically.
Output requirements:
Execute tasks sequentially and exhaustively.
Provide a final completion report only after all tasks are done.
The final message must clearly state: “ALL TASKS COMPLETED”.
Performance constraints:
Prioritize speed, correctness, and consistency.
Use parallelism where safe, but never stop progress.
Start now and continue until 100% of tasks are finished in this single run.
